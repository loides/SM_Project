# SM_Project
 Smart Motion Project

 As of now, Docker isn't implemented yet, so, to run this, you need to:
 - 1: Start MongoDB with the standart port (27017);
 - 2: Start the backend with Spring Boot (port 8080, already configured);
 - 3: Start the frontend with React (port 8081, already configured).

 In the future, these 3 components will be dockerized and composed, 
    and you will be able to run this in a whole container.
